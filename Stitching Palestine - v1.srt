1
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,959
Where did I grow up? In Jerusalem.

2
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,479
I'm a resolute Jerusalemite.

HUDA AL-IMAM FOUNDER & DIRECTOR CENTER
FOR JERUSALEM STUDIES, JERUSALEM UNIVERSITY

4
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,159
I am a resident of Ramallah,
my family is originally from a village called Al-Haditheh

5
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,879
near Ledd and Jaffa.
The village has been destroyed.

6

LEILA ATSHAN
CONSULTANT PSYCHOTHERAPIST

7
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,839
I did not leave!
They forced us to leave.

8
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,599
We were forced out in 1948.

9
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,439
I was 4 years old at the time.

10
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,999
MEMBER, PALESTINE NATIONAL COUNCIL MEMBER, POLITICAL
BUREAU, POPULAR FRONT FOR THE LIBERATION OF PALESTINE

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,039

MARY NAZZAL BATAYNEH
BARRISTER AT LAW/ ACTIVIST

13
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,879
We left over several phases.

14
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,679
We went back and forth a number of times.

15
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,039
MALAK AL-HUSSEINI ABDELRAHIM FOUNDING MEMBER, ASSOCIATION
FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF PALESTINIAN CAMPS (INAASH)

16
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,879
Maybe if I were in Meiroun now,

17
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,799
I might not necessarily be living in the village,

18
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,359
I might be living in Haifa, for example,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,119
AMAL ZIAD KAAWASH
ARTIST & SINGER/ SONGWRITER

20
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,959
Every single day, as I return home

21
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,919
I slow the car down
and look out at Jerusalem

22
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,959
I take a deep breath

23
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,359
especially under the snow in winter

24
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,879
when the weather is good

25
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,639
I think to myself “This is why I am here”.

26
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,759
DINA NASSER
REGISTERED NURSE & HEALTH ADVISOR

27
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,079
My father's family left in 1948

28
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,479
and fled to Nabatiyyeh

29
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,119
then my mother and father got married
and went to live in Tal al-Zaatar Camp.

30
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,119
From Tal al-Zaatar
we came to Mar Elias Camp

31
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,439
and we are still here
in Mar Elias Camp.

32
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,679
NAZMIYEH SALEM
EMBROIDERER

33
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,359
We were always moving from place to place

34
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,599
it was something of a nomadic life

35
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,599
every few years we'd move to a different place.

36
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,199
Then, my parents immigrated to Canada

37
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,279
and my sons studied there,

38
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,319
so, it's really a geographic mosaic.

39

SALMA AL-YASSIR DIRECTOR GENERAL
INSTITUTE FOR PALESTINE STUDIES

40
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,799
I was born in Jerusalem,

41
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,319
we then lived in Amman for a while,

42
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,679
then we moved to Beirut,

43
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,079
then I went to Tunis,

44
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,599
then I went to the US.

45
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,239
Finally, I returned to Ramallah.

46
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,719
RAEDA TAHA WRITER & ACTOR
DIRECTOR KHALIL SAKAKINI FOUNDATION

47
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:17,359
In 1981, I went to Palestine on a visit,
to study Palestinian architecture.

48
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,519
I thought I would be there for only six months.

49
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,919
I fell in love with Palestine

50
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,839
and I fell in love with a man in Palestine

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,599
and as a result I decided to take up
a teaching post at Birzeit University.

52

SUAD AL-AMIRY FOUNDER &
DIRECTOR, RIWAQ NOVELIST

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,959
I truly regret it

54
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,279
because we could have
continued to go until 1967.

55
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,759
We had 10 years,

56
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,439
but... I don't know.

57
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,199
SIMA TUQAN GHANDOUR FOUNDING MEMBER, ASSOCIATION
FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF PALESTINIAN CAMPS (INAASH)

58
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,879
With every stitch,

59
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,879
she hides a story,

60
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,279
a thought,

61
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,599
a sigh.

62
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,999
Inside each of us,

63
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,559
inside the map of Palestine,

64
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,879
our stories were like threads

65
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,599
that separate then come together,

66
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,199
recounted and then hidden,

67
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:36,999
when faced with the "knot" of occupation.

68
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,559
A knot that rearranged all the threads,

69
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,119
scattering them in all directions.

70
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,479
A single life was now assigned two threads:

71
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,519
one thread that is real,

72
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,919
another that could have been.

73
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,639
The stories transcended Palestine.

74
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,639
Their threads dispersed, seeking refuge or exile.

75
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,479
Those women who remained in their homeland
were accused of non-existence.

76
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,079
It was said to them: You are not here.

77
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,519
They responded:

78
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,359
We are not a lie inside a plot,

79
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,719
we are here.

80
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,479
And wherever we are,

81
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,879
we narrate stories in detail,

82
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,239
embroidering them on the face of our earth.

83
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,479
Some are privileged,

84
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,999
others bearing life in a camp.

85
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,279
First, second, third generation.

86
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,159
Accents and cities,

87
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,999
classes and cultures differ.

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,599
They are very different from one another

89
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,719
but all meet at one turning point

90
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,879
where all threads meet:

91
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,599
the before and the after,

92
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,119
before 1948, and after it.

93
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,479
At that turning point,
Palestine was transformed.

94
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,999
It became a homeland the size of a planet.

95
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,319
Both my mother and father are Lebanese

96
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,319
entirely Lebanese.

97
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,679
They are originally from Tyre.

98
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,599
But my father went to Palestine,
at that time there were no borders

99
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,519
and people would go there in search of work.

100
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,079
50, my father went to Palestine to work.

101
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,279
He returned, married my mother
and they went back to live in Haifa.

102
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,599
When we were forced out
they returned to Tyre.

103
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,519
My mother took us
to her uncle's house in the city of Tyre.

104
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,919
It is quite close to Haifa,
only about an hour and a half away.

105
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,279
When we arrived at my mother's uncle's house,
there was an entrance lined with orange trees.

106
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,839
The oranges were still on the trees.

107
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,639
As we approached to pick oranges,

108
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,759
my mother slapped our wrists like this.

109
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,559
"These are not your oranges

110
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,959
your oranges are in Haifa.

111
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:57,839
These are not yours.”

112
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,079
We are not supposed to touch what is not ours.

113
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,999
Ever since that moment,
I have hated oranges.

114
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,439
Every time I see oranges,
I remember that moment

115
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,479
that “These are not yours”

116
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,199
that "Your oranges are in Palestine, in Haifa.”

117
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,919
My father was granted a permit

118
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,679
to meet his mother at the Mandelbaum Gate.

119
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,479
This was in 1964.

120
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,359
He went there,

121
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,959
of course, he needed a permit to come to Jordan,

122
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,199
papers from the International Red Cross and so on.

123
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,199
He spent 3 days at the Mandelbaum Gate

124
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,559
without seeing his mother

125
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,719
because the Israelis had not notified
his mother that her son was coming.

126
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,239
My father came back,

127
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,519
a little while later
he suffered a stroke and was paralyzed.

128
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,639
He never got to see his mother.

129
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,239
Whenever I see anything Palestinian,

130
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,679
whether a painting or an olive branch,

131
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,599
I long to return to Palestine.

132
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,879
I'm not the only one,

133
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,679
all of us refugees
want to return to Palestine.

134
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,359
I became involved in military
operations, from a young age.

135
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,919
It made me feel that Palestine was closer.

136
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,519
The more politically involved I became,

137
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,239
the closer I felt to Palestine.

138
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,519
I don't mean geographical closeness

139
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,399
but emotionally and in my being.

140
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,319
I was elated.

141
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,879
I remember the first three nights in the camp,

142
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,119
I didn't sleep,

143
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,439
I didn't sleep a wink.

144
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,519
I told them I was ready to stay on guard duty
all the time, every single day,

145
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,359
I told them I was ready to stay on guard duty
all the time, every single day,

146
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,479
without sleep.

147
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,879
When I first held a rifle,

148
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,159
I felt like...

149
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,599
I was not married at the time,

150
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,279
but I used to feel that the rifle

151
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,079
was like a baby
being cradled in its mother's arms

152
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,279
That's how I felt.

153
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,919
I would hold it protectively.

154
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,599
I felt that the rifle
would take me to Palestine.

155
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,199
It would take us all back.

156
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,319
Of course, I had been educated about this.

157
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,999
We were, educated about Why.we.'
were engaged in armed struggle.

158
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,239
All the readings on popular revolutions,

159
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,799
especially the Algerian women's struggle,

160
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,279
especially the Algerian women's struggle,

161
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,679
the 'Jamilat' who had
performed all those heroic feats.

162
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,639
The 'Jamilat' who had
performed all those heroic feats.

163
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,119
I used to wonder,

164
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,919
why aren't we like them?

165
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,839
Why don't we do what they have done?

166
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,679
These real-life experiences

167
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,599
gave us more hope and dreams

168
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,839
that it can become a reality.

169
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,479
Algeria was under French
colonization for 130 years,

170
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,519
colonization, torture of women,
assassinatlons etc...

171
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,799
Yet, they were liberated.

172
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,239
That means that we too can liberate Palestine.

173
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,079
These are the kinds of
comparisons we would make.

174
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,959
I would imagine how I was
going to arm we in Haifa,

175
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,399
how I would pick oranges
and eat them with their peel

176
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,479
and find dates.

177
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,319
Isn't it funny? You would
be working on something big

178
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,079
but it's those small dreams...

179
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,839
no one would smack me on the wrists and say</br>"These aren't your oranges!'"

180
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,119
When I got married
I wore the traditional robe.

181
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,439
I didn't have a wedding

182
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,959
but I wore the 'thobe'.

183
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,519
For me it was
a kind of attachment,

184
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,439
)
not only in the political sense, .- -*

185
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,479
but because this is
a symboll of who we are.

186
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,239
In 1975,

187
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,959
we were attend in a conference

188
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,799
when a group of girls wearing
Palestinian 'thobes' passed by.

189
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,719
I asked “Where are these girls from?”

190
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,479
They turned out to be Israelis.

191
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,239
We went berserk!

192
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,239
"How dare they wear our 'thobe'?!”

193
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,879
It does not belong to them.

194
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,799
So we took a decision that the entire
delegation would wear 'thobes' and put on 'kuffiyas',

195
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,639
People started coming up to us
and asking "Are they in your delegation?”' -

196
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,719
We would answer '“No! Those are
the people who stole our country

197
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,799
and stole our heritage.'

198
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,959
That's it.
They are the thieves,

199
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,879
we are the real people of the land,

200
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,079
we are the real bearers of the 'thobes'.

201
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,199
In my case, I could not
afford to buy a 'thobe'.

202
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,279
Personally, I didn't have
the financial means to buy a 'thobe'.

203
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,079
When I went to Kuwait

204
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,079
as part of an official delegation

205
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,239
after my the military operation,

206
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,319
a woman came up to me and said

207
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,399
"I want to give you a 'thobe' as a gift",
she was an old woman

208
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,959
she had embroidered it herself.

209
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,919
You see, In the past each girl
used to embroider her own 'thobes'

210
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,759
and keep them safe in her chest.

211
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,559
Those who had
embroidered several 'thobes'..

212
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,119
Each 'thobe' requires a
lot of work, around six months.

213
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,519
This woman gave me the first
'thobe' she had ever embroidered.

214
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,119
According to her, this was
the most beautiful 'thobe' she owned.

215
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,759
I took it and I still have it until now.

216
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,479


217
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,439
Another woman gave me a 'thobe' as a gift.

218
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,119
The 'King Thobe' is the wedding 'thobe',

219
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,919
it is usually embroidered with a golden thread.

220
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,199
She had prepared it for her son's bride

221
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,719
but her son was martyred.

222
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,599
So she gave it to me.

223
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,759
She said to me "No one would
take better care of it than you.”

224
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,919
This was in Lebanon,
where the martyr's mother lived.

225
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,079
The bride-to-be hadn't
had a chance to wear it.

226
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,239
I took it and I told her

227
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,639
“I will not wear it
until I return to Palestine.

228
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,039
It is a very precious gift
that you are giving me.”

229
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,199
It was made by a mother
for her son who was martyred.

230
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,079
I will never forget this.

231
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,759
Imagine...even as I am
speaking now, I remember

232
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,079
how much pain this mother is in

233
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,839
over the loss of her son
who was about to get married.

234
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,439
She had prepared his bride's 'thobe',

235
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,759
she couldn't find a way

236
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,039
she wanted to give it to someone

237
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,959
she didn't keep it for herself.

238
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,119
For her to give it to me..

239
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,679
This was the most valuable gift
I have ever received.. until this day.

240
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,879
Unfortunately, during the 1982 war, the Israeli
invasion of Lebanon, this 'thobe' was destroyed.

241
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,839
I'm from Jerusalem.

242
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,079
We left in several phases.

243
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,199
We went back and forth a number of times.

244
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,039
The 1936 Revolt had started

245
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,359
and my father was wanted
by the British army.

246
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,519
That's why we had to leave Jerusalem.

247
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,119
My father had to flee
and he took the familiy.

248
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,679
We came to Lebanon for a short while

249
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,519
but then the French came to Lebanon,

250
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,119
we had to flee from them

251
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,119
so, we went to Baghdad.

252
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,759
We stayed there for a few years

253
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,359
but the British were
searching for my father again

254
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,439
and he fled to Iran.

255
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,319
In Iran, they captured him.

256
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,159
They captured him and took him to Rhodesia,

257
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,959
it's now called Zimbabwe,

258
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,719
they kept him in jail for five years.

259
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,799
Meanwhile, we went back to Jerusalem

260
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:37,439
and I went to the Quaker school in Ramallah.

261
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,479
Then, I came here to Lebanon
to attend the Junior College.

262
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,559
We did go back

263
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,759
because they processed the Family
Reunification documents for us

264
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,759
it's for Palestinian families.

265
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,199
The Israelis gave all my sisters Jerusalem IDs

266
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,479
but they refused to give me a Jerusalem ID
I was given a Jericho ID.

267
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,759
I asked, "Why have you given me a Jericho ID?

268
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,839
I was born in the German Hospital in Jerusalem!"

269
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,759
They said, No, we've given you enough Jerusalem IDs.

270
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,199
I have maintained my connection,

271
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,519
we need to go once every 3 years

272
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,319
we need to go there.

273
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,079
To the West Bank,
I can go whenever I want.

274
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,959
But the problem is, what do I have in Jericho?

275
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,519
Our house in Jericho is abandoned,

276
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,479
my sisters all go to Jerusalem,

277
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,159
we had many houses,
but they're all gone now

278
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,599
we have to stay in a hotel.

279
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,119
I used to sneak in from Jericho

280
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,919
they would smuggle me into Jerusalem

281
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,519
straight to the hotel.

282
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,319
Sometimes I'd go out,

283
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,839
but when I do go out
I feel very sorry for myself.

284
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,919
I think to myself, Curse them,

285
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,919
this is my country
yet I'm scurrying along like a mouse

286
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,239
frightened of being seen

287
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,959
I scurry along near the walls and corners;

288
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,119
This is my country, I was born here

289
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,359
my parents died here and are buried here

290
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,839
and I'm made to feel like a prisoner.

291
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,839
Do you remember your house?

292
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,679
Our house?
Yes, yes, it's with the Jewish settlers now.

293
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,519
It's in the Messrarah area.

294
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,919
I’ll tell you the story with my mother,

295
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,959
the first time we went,
it was with my mother

296
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,999
we were all together, all the sisters,

297
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,399
my mother insisted she wanted to go see her house

298
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,239
it was her father's house.

299
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,879
It was a very large house,

300
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,679
one of the oldest in Jerusalem.

301
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,879
They were the first family to leave the Old City

302
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,519
and move to the new city.

303
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,119
They just crossed the road
and built a house there.

304
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,799
He built a huge spacious house.

305
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,959
When the problems started, we left
and the Jewish settlers confiscated it

306
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,439
all of it.

307
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,519
It had close to 40 rooms that they had rented out.

308
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,079
50, my mother took us with her to Messrarah,

309
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,319
we protested that we couldn't face it

310
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,999
but she insisted,
"Even if you can't I want to see it...

311
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,559
We took a taxi and drove there
we stopped in front of the house

312
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,559
my mother got down with her cane,

313
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,479
she must have been 75 or 80 years old

314
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,719
there she stood with her cane.

315
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,359
We refused to get out of the car

316
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,119
and sat there crying and frightened.

317
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,719
She got out with her cane,

318
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,759
climbed up the front stairs,
and knocked on the door with her cane

319
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,359
like so...
tick ... tick ... tick

320
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,279
The Jewish settler opened the door,
the lady renting the house,

321
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,799
my mother said “I want to see my house!”

322
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,359
The woman answered “No madam)
this is our house, we have bought rt”.

323
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,239
She answered "I've never sold it,

324
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,239
my father built it”

325
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,479
she kept saying "My father built this house, my father,

326
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,279
I want to see every room”.

327
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,279


328
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,879
Embroidery is important for me because
I have been surrounded by it my entire life.

329
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,839
I've been seeing embroidery my whole life,
ever since we were in Jerusalem.

330
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,759
When I first opened my eyes

331
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,039
our Nanny was wearing the 'thobe'

332
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,159
I would see how it was embroidered all over.

333
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,279
When we went to the village, to Jericho,

334
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,119
<i>\</i>
we would see the women at the water spring

335
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,999
all wearing beautiful dresses.

336
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,559
However, it had never occurred
to us to learn from them,

337
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,319
or to copy their designs.

338
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,559
We just knew that it was
something very beautiful.

339
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,159
Now our country is gone,
we don't have our country any more,

340
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,799
but we have embroidery

341
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,919
and this, no one can take away from you.

342
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,919
When you're embroidering a piece, it is yours.

343
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,279
It gives me a lot of pride <i>»</i>
when I see how beautifully it turns out.

344
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,399
I used to do European style cross stitching.

345
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,959
I would be happy with it,
but it wasn't personal to me.

346
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,479
Now, when we produce a beautiful piece,

347
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,279
it's my national embroidery.

348
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,039
It has become a nationalist issue for me.

349
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:38,559
It's more than embroidery,
it's about national belonging.

350
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,879
All our work at INAASH since the
very beginning up until now

351
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,599
Is based on designs and
motifs from old thobes'

352
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,519
going back to around 1848

353
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,199
this period of 100 years.

354
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,119
All this embroidery is derived from that period.

355
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,879
The 12 windows project began
about 25 or 30 years ago.

356
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,639
When we still had hope of establishing our own State.

357
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,479
We wanted to create something
that we can present to our State

358
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,799
we thought of a producing a large mural

359
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,079
depicting the different regions of Palestine

360
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,759
which would be our gift,
whether to our Parliament,

361
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,759
or national museum,

362
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,519
to be our gift to Palestine.

363
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,839
Recently, we decided to revive this project.

364
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,119
We began to think "Why not
work on different regions of Palestine"?

365
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,439
We did our initial research and found
that there are roughly 12 embroidery regions.

366
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,359
50, according to those 12 regions,
we named the project '12 Windows'

367
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,319
Palestine, from its North to its South.

368
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,639
In all cases, it's too late

369
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,279
I am now ...

370
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,639
I won't tell you how old I am,
but I'm very old.

371
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,999
Would you like to know?

372
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,159
I turned 85 yesterday!

373
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,919
Yesterday I became 85 years old,
what would I go do now?

374
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,039
To start with, I cannot cross the bridge,

375
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,479
I cannot ride 4 buses
and carry my suitcase on and off.

376
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,879
And I have nowhere to go.

377
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,159
In Jericho, there are no hotels.

378
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,119
I am not allowed to go to Jerusalem.

379
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,719
If they know that I go,
they'll kick me out on the spot.

380
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,959
I'm listed as being from the West Bank,

381
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,999
but the only thing I know is Jerusalem,

382
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,239
That's where I grew up,
I want to go to Jerusalem.

383
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:28,839


384
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,839


385
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:30,959


386
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:22,799


387
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,439


388
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,559


389
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,519
——

390
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:17,679


391
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,279
I was born In Jafa
but we lived in Jerusalem

392
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,839
We left Jerusalem in 1948

393
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,199
and came directly to Lebanon, straight here

394
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,839
I remained a few month without school

395
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,959
then | went to Alexandria

396
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,999
where | spent a year at school in Alexandria

397
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,199
I finished school

398
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,559
and returned to Lebanon.

399
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,039
I'm one of the very early ones.

400
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,279
Primarily, I have only
worked in embroidery at INAASH,

401
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,959
and this is what I still do,

402
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,079
this is my job.

403
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,719
And that's it.

404
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,079
This is my place at INAASH.

405
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,999
One day I was at a meeting
of the Friends of Jerusalem,

406
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,719
Huguette Caland happened to be passing by

407
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,919
She is the daughter of Beshara Al-Khoury,
the former President of Lebanon.

408
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,679
She stopped to talk to me,

409
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,319
she said "SIMA,

410
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,319
Chermine GHANDOUR Hneineh and |

411
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,079
are thinking of doing something for Palestine”.

412
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,919
This was after 1967,
you must remember.

413
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:03,239
She said something
that I will never forget,

414
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,559
something very beautiful.

415
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,079
Every time I tell this story I start to cry...

416
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,599
"One day, we will have Palestine back

417
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,039
and everything Palestinian
must return with it

418
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,159
heritage, food, whatever.

419
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,199
We prepare it here,

420
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,839
and when we get Palestine back,
all this will return with it.”

421
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,559
Our needlework started with 'tricot'

422
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,399
but, that is not Palestinian work

423
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,119
it has nothing to do with Palestine.

424
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,639
So we began to search
for mothers, older women

425
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,719
for those who had pieces
at home, who had 'thobes'

426
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,039
and we started with what we had.

427
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,759
We decided to start by making cushions.

428
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:49,799
And it took off.

429
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,639
We then produced a generation
that knows how to embroider,

430
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,679
and another generation that embroiders,

431
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,639
we provide them with the materials,
and the design, the main lines,

432
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,199
and they put it together
according to their tastes.

433
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,919
They remain at home,

434
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,479
they embroider at home,

435
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,799
they have an income,

436
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,119
and at the same time
they look after their children

437
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,039
and perform their household duties.

438
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,279
Let me tell you what
embroidery signifies to me.

439
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,439
When I was a little girl in Jerusalem

440
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,159
I remember making myself a skirt.

441
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,879
A seamstress came and
sewed a black skirt for me

442
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,839
and I embroidered it all around the hem.

443
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,079
At that time we used to embroider
camels, and Bedouins with canes,

444
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,999
all of these went on my skirt.

445
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,959
I embroidered all of them

446
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,999
and I used to wear It.

447
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,159
I used to love embroidery.

448
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,439
At the nuns' school,

449
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,679
they teach you embroidery,

450
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,879
they teach you sewing,

451
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,879
they teach you everything.

452
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,519
I also remember the village women
who used to come to Jerusalem.

453
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,479
Some selling eggs

454
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,279
door to door, carrying baskets

455
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:55,479
some who came to do our laundry,
we didn’t have washing machines then.

456
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,799
They were all around us,
Jerusalem was surrounded by villages.

457
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,759
To me, embroidery was linked to villages.

458
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:10,319
In Jerusalem, we lived in
an area that the British had zoned off.

459
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,039
You could only enter and leave with a pass.

460
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,679
It is al-Baqa'a al-Fawqa and Qatamoun.

461
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,839
My grandfather's house was in Jaffa

462
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,319
and I was always going back
and forth to my grandparents'.

463
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,839
I lived at my grandparents'
as much as I did with my mother and father.

464
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,359
I was very close to my
grandmother and grandfather.

465
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,599
For me, Jaffa is part of me.

466
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,559
As soon as school closed for holidays,

467
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,119
my mother would immediately pack
my bag and put me on the bus,

468
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,479
the public busses,

469
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,039
she’d ship me off to Jaffa.

470
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,559
I'd go by bus

471
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,359
and they would meet me
at the other end.

472
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,079
I'd spent the entire summer
I'd stay in Jaffa.

473
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,439
Jaffa, Jaffa is part of me

474
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,959
Oh! I loved Jaffa.

475
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,279
What happened to it?

476
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,239
You can't imagine what has happened to it.

477
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,359
He brought me photos,

478
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,599
I almost fainted!

479
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,959
The house is on Salameh Street

480
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,239
it's in an area between Tel Aviv and Jaffa.

481
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,679
Now, it's between
Tel Aviv and Jaffa,

482
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,799
it used to be Jaffa.

483
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,999
It also had an orange orchard

484
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,319
half the orchard had also
been destroyed earlier

485
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,839
but it was a large house.

486
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,319
When my mother was first
married, they lived there.

487
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,839
The house is there,

488
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,919
but it's In a terrible state.

489
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:23,679
Of course, there's no more orchard,
or garden or anything,

490
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,479
they've even pulled down the balcony.

491
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,639
What can I tell you, it's horrible.

492
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,159
When he showed it to me

493
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,279
I said, "Why would you show it to me?

494
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:31,919
I don't want to see.

495
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,839
Let me stay with my souvenirs".

496
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,879
It's horrible.

497
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,519
Like everyone else we thought

498
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,639
it would be a matter of 15 days and we would return.

499
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,439
15 days...

500
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,879
Go for 15 days then you can return.

501
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,679
My father went to Nablus

502
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,439
and we went

503
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,279
via Amman

504
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:02,079
because Haifa was over,
it had been taken over,

505
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,399
via Amman to Beirut.

506
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,439
To Broumana not Beirut.

507
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,799
Broumana, up there!

508
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,759
It was a horrible journey.

509
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,879
There was me, my mother,

510
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,719
my uncle was driving,

511
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,239
and one of my brothers was with us

512
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,079
the youngest, Usama, was with us.

513
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,759
Sami, funnily enough, stayed
behind at St. George's School.

514
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,839
He stayed on behind us.

515
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,719
Later, they brought him out.

516
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,079
We went directly to Broumana.

517
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,319
And I remember
my mother never stopped crying.

518
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,839
From the beginning of
our journey to the very end.

519
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,039
And that was it.

520
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,799
Then from Broumana
we moved to Beirut.

521
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,519
And that was it.

522
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,439
The 15 days became
how long? 65 years?

523
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,119
That's it.

524
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,559
My father is from Jaffa

525
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,079
and my mother is from the district of Haifa.

526
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,559
My father's parents were displaced to Lebanon,

527
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,759
and my mother's family went to Jordan,

528
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,439
so I was born in Amman,

529
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,279
because my mother wanted\
to give birth near her family!

530
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,479
but at the time,
we were living in Lebanon.

531
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,239
After Lebanon, my father went
to work in Saudi Arabia,

532
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,279
I returned here to Beirut,

533
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,159
and stayed in a hoarding school for a while.

534
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,839
During the war (in Lebanon)
we moved around,

535
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,959
we went to Jordan,

536
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,639
returned to Lebanon,

537
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,599
then we went to the UK.

538
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,999
I studied in the UK
and graduated from there.

539
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,279
I returned to Lebanon for a short time

540
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,799
then I got married and moved to Cyprus

541
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,639
where I stayed for around 14 years.

542
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,719
After that, my parents emigrated to Canada,

543
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,039
my children studied there,

544
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:14,039
so, it's really a mosaic of geographical locations.

545
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,639
This piece of embroidery reminds me of Palestine.

546
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,759
I love blue because I love the sea.

547
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,479
I am a daughter of Jaffa.

548
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,599
Jaffa and the sea are in my blood,

549
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:30,359
the memory of the sea of Jaffa
through my father

550
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,959
we grew up with stories...

551
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,799
For me, it's linked to my memory

552
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,439
as if it's part of me.

553
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,919
It's very significant to me,
maybe it's in the genes,

554
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,199
I tell you my grandfather was a seaman.

555
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,479
He worked in the sea.

556
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,199
They owned barges to transport oranges.

557
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,879
As you know, Jaffa is all orchards

558
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,319
there was trade,

559
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:54,319
and the transport of goods, especially oranges.

560
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,039
They lost all of it.

561
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:05,359
Now I've heard wild tales of how
they used to put gold coins in tins

562
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,679
and bury them under the ground.

563
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:11,239
Now, just how true that is, I don't know

564
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,279
but these are the tales they tell,

565
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,719
that they left behind them many things

566
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,799
they left properties,

567
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,439
they left money...

568
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,519
They left thinking that they would be returning,

569
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,919
like everyone else.

570
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,959
But they remained here.

571
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,479
As far as I know, the family
did not all leave at once.

572
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,159
My grandmother stayed behind for a while,

573
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,719
and my grandfather took the children,

574
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,999
then my uncle went back for my grandmother.

575
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,879
From what I've heard,
my grandmother was a tough Jaffa woman.

576
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,199
She had her standing

577
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,239
it wasn't easy for them to convince her to leave.

578
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,799
It was actually she,
who insisted that I my father get an education

579
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,079
my father and his younger siblings.

580
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,239
My grandfather had wanted them
to work with him in the sea,

581
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:01,159
but my grandmother put her foot down
insisting that he gets an education.

582
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,519
I myself grew up with Jaffa,

583
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,919
I grew up with the idea of Jaffa.

584
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,919
It was as if we were there.

585
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,039
From the stories,

586
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,719
what the house was like,

587
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,919
how my grandfather would come
into the house with muddied shoes,

588
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,439
and how my grandmother
would chastise him

589
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,839
"You soiled my floors",

590
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,199
etc. etc.

591
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,279
How there was a basin near the entrance,

592
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,319
she was obsessive about cleanliness.

593
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,399
50, we were able to imagine
what the house was like.

594
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,879
They were 7 brothers.

595
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,439
As youngsters, they used to
like to run away from school.

596
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,639
They would skip school
and go swimming in the sea.

597
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,719
My grandmother, who was known
to be a very tough woman..

598
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,599
They would wait for the school day to end,
then come home pretending they'd been at school.

599
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,559
She'd ask where they'd been
and they'd answer 'At school”.

600
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,399
If she doubted them,
she would hold them one by one

601
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,479
and she would lick them to see
if they tasted of salt,

602
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,239
and they would receive a beating.

603
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,799
For us, it's like a borrowed memory

604
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,879
it's not my own memory,

605
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:03,839
it's my father's.

606
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,599
But it nests within you.

607
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,079
My sons definitely consider themselves Palestinians,

608
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,959
they grew up with it.

609
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,639
When they grew up and went to university,

610
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:21,239
what I really loved was how they would sit
and talk with their grandfather, my father.

611
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,999
All their questions,
they wouldn't ask me or their father,

612
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,239
they would ask their grandfather, because
he is the principal link with Palestine.

613
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,119
They would go over many of the stories,

614
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,519
many of the tales,

615
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,959
which created this link between the two generations.

616
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,679
You could hear them going deep into this memory

617
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,239
which is a part of the collective memory.

618
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,079
When my children started school,
I made a promise to myself

619
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,679
that they would remain in one place.

620
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:52,279
This being constantly on the move
makes one always feel like an alien,

621
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,959
a feeling that is carried on the inside
wherever you go

622
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,999
I don't believe that there is a place
where I have felt that I truly belong

623
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,559
that I'm a 100% from that place.

624
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,679
The place where I feel that, is in my imagination,

625
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,119
it's in my country Palestine.

626
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,399
But in reality, I never felt that sense of belonging,

627
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,799
that I am from a place,
that I am organically from there.

628
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,479
Lebanon is probably
the nearest thing to a homeland

629
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,119
but I always feel a sense of alienation.

630
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,519
As soon as I open my mouth

631
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,839
and start to speak

632
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,199
I immediately get the question:

633
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,919
- Would you like to go to Jaffa?

634
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,879
Me? I would love to.

635
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,519
I wish I could, I wish I could go to Jaffa.

636
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:48,639
You know how an orphan always
wants to meet their biological parents?

637
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:53,159
Even if they had abandoned him,
even if there were tragic conditions,

638
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,359
I feel like something of an orphan

639
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,719
I feel far from my roots and origins.

640
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,039
[ Remember when I was in Jaffa

641
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,359
Speak to us
ell us of Jaffa

642
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,679
My sail in the Port of Jaffa

643
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,039
O for the fishing days in Jaffa

644
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,279
I am from Fureidis,
In the District of Haifa

645
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,439
I am a resident of Mar Elias Camp.

646
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,679
My father's family left in 1948

647
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:01,079
and fled to Nabatiyyeh

648
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,799
then my mother and father got married
and went to live in Tal el-Zaatar Camp.

649
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,839
From Tal el-Zaatar
we came to Mar Elias Camp

650
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,239
and we are still here
in Mar Elias Camp.

651
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,119
We were still young, and my father

652
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,239
may God have mercy on his soul,
was killed in Tal el-Zaatar Camp

653
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,319
I mean he was never found,
we never knew whether he was dead or alive.

654
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,679
He's been missing since 1976.

655
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,079
My mother brought us up.

656
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,919
We are 8 girls and 2 boys,

657
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,599
in total 10 children. <i>/\;</i> -

658
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,879
My mother used to work

659
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,359
she was a cook in
one of the organizations

660
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,079
to be able to raise us.

661
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,599
It wasn't easy for her to raise us.

662
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:51,279
She also worked here,
in a school close to the Camp.

663
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,799
We also used to work cleaning houses.

664
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,319
When we first came out of Tal el-Zaatar

665
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,439
we went through hard times,

666
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,079
we went through difficult days.

667
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,959
My father was gone,

668
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,479
May God have mercy
on his soul, if he's dead.

669
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,759
Surely, he can't still be alive...

670
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,959
He must have grown old and
God has probably taken him back.

671
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:17,199
My mother used to tell us about
Palestine but not as much as she should have

672
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,119
because she worked,
and was both a father and a mother to us.

673
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,399
because she worked,
and was both a father and a mother to us.

674
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,239
She had to raise a family of 10.

675
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,799
She told us only a few things

676
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,679
about Haifa,

677
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,119
about Fureidis

678
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,879
but only briefly,

679
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,439
not in any detail, not thoroughly.

680
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,279
When I first learned to embroider

681
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,399
I was around 13 or 14 years old.

682
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:50,559
About 28 or 29 years, a long time.

683
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,679
My sister-in-law taught me how to embroider

684
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,839
and I started doing it

685
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,919
and I'm still doing it regularly until now.

686
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:03,639
I could say embroidery now flows in my blood.

687
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,159
I cannot stop, I mean I cannot leave it.

688
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,879
There are 6 of us sisters who embroider

689
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,879
and my sister-in-law embroiders

690
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,599
so does my other sister-in-law

691
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,039
so do my nieces.

692
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,639
We get together with the neighbors,

693
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,599
and here we are, surviving.

694
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,079
We don't have a particular place we gather in.

695
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,799
In the summer we sit outdoors,

696
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,239
in the winter we go inside,

697
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,879
each one takes a corner,
she sits there and...

698
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,679
we all work on our embroidery.

699
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,599
In the past in Palestine,
women used to gather

700
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,639
in front of their houses

701
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,359
and also after leaving Palestine,

702
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,639
they would gather and embroider

703
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,999
they would put a basket with
all the balls of threads in the middle

704
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,799
and the women would sit ...

705
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,399
a word here and a word there

706
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,759
a stitch here, a stitch there,
and the time would pass.

707
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,919
While we're working on our embroidery,
we talk about all sorts of things.

708
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,119
I am very fast.

709
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:16,079
I work about 8 or 9 hours a day.

710
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,239
It depends on my circumstances

711
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,639
it depends on how much time I have,

712
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,719
the responsibilities of the house,

713
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,359
cooking, washing,

714
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,599
helping my children with their school work.

715
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,599
She gets up at 4am.

716
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,119
She performs ablutions, prays,
and then sits until 7:30am.

717
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,119
You know? I like solitude.

718
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,879
I like to sit by myself.

719
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,319
When I'm alone

720
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,919
I think of my children,

721
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,919
my thoughts drift to my children,

722
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,199
I think of myself,

723
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,279
my health, my well being.

724
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,839
I reflect on all sorts of things.

725
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,399
How to sort this or that out,

726
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,999
how to manage and get by.

727
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:59,239
By the grace of God
thoughts always drift and wander.

728
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,399
My head starts to spin with thoughts.

729
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,719
I like to embroider at night.

730
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,799
After I put the children to bed,

731
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,079
that's when I like to sit down and embroider

732
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,439
I stay until 11pm or midnight.

733
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,439
Sometimes, when there
are school holidays

734
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,599
I keep going until 1 or 2am,

735
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,919
I have no problem,
I keep working and I'm productive.

736
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,559
To tell you the truth, there are
two pieces that are dear to my heart.

737
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,559
The Beit Dajan piece that
took me two and a half months to finish.

738
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,239
I don't know how, but I felt that
I was in the heart of Palestine.

739
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,519
The Jerusalem piece in particular,

740
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,079
I finished it in 5 months and 17 days.

741
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,159
The Jerusalem piece...

742
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,719
How can I put it?

743
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:51,319
It gave me the incentive
to continue working on this project,

744
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,319
and to keep on embroidering

745
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,479
to ensure that embroidery will
never die out and disappear, never ever.

746
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:01,959
We will return one day to our neighborhood

747
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,719
and drown in...

748
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,959
I long to go there

749
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,359
I wish I could go there

750
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,039
visit Jerusalem

751
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,159
visit Fureidis

752
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,359
because people generally don't know Fureidis

753
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:20,959
they know Haifa,
not Fureidis the town, the village.

754
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:27,879
Oh heart how we have been displaced by the winds

755
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,839
Come, we will return

756
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:38,359
Come with me

757
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,439
My name is Amal ZIAD KAAWASH

758
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,879
I am a Palestinian born in Lebanon.

759
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,759
We are originally from Meiroun

760
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,159
a village in the North of Palestine,
in the district of Safad.

761
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,439
Meiroun is the village of the KAAWASH family.

762
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:32,159
What's particular about the village
is that only the KAAWASH family lived there.

763
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,559
It is a tiny village,

764
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,119
it is currently a religious Jewish Settlement.

765
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:43,239
Because all the inhabitants were from one family,
it is sometimes referred to as Meiroon KAAWASH.

766
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,919
Many members from the KAAWASH family
name their daughters Meiroun KAAWASH.

767
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,479
I do not have the Lebanese nationality,

768
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,839
neither do my mother and father.

769
00:45:53,880 --> 00:46:00,519
Officially, I am still considered
a Palestinian refugee in Lebanon

770
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:05,999
and we carry the blue identity card which is

771
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,039
If we need to travel, we have a
special travel document for Palestinians

772
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,439
which Palestinians sometimes
call the 'coloring book'.

773
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:19,759
In this piece of embroidery, the part
that's meant to be the front-piece, the collar

774
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,439
the square-shaped collar

775
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,879
reminded me of a house.

776
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:28,919
It immediately reminded me of the
remains of the last house in Meiroun,

777
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,439
the house of the late Abu Talal KAAWASH.

778
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:36,319
Only one or two walls
of the house still stand

779
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:40,879
but it still gives the impression that
it is standing tall and watching people.

780
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,839
It's as if the openings or windows are eyes.

781
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:51,039
As if it can see the people looking
at its picture, those of us in the Diaspora

782
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,799
There is a character that I draw,
her name is Meiroun...

783
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,439
Meiroun is my daughter
who was born on paper.

784
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,119
She is a silhouette,

785
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,799
we do not see her face,

786
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,519
but we see that she is a girl, a silhouette.

787
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,239
She has two long braids

788
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,959
and she loves to play with
the moon, all the time.

789
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,639
When I called my blog Meiroun,

790
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,519
and when I named this girl Meiroun,

791
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:30,479
I wanted people who
had never heard of this tiny village

792
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,559
to get to know its name.

793
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:40,599
Now, almost eight years after
the birth of Meiroun the girl,

794
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,359
I am happy that very often
people mention Meiroun

795
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,719
without knowing its
connection with Amal KAAWASH.

796
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,439
It made me feel that
I had achieved something.

797
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,079
Perhaps the 'virtual liberation'
of the village of Meiroun.

798
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,599
Meiroun doesn't grow up.

799
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,879
She loves to play with balloons.

800
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,319
To her, the moon is like a balloon

801
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:57,479
she flies it high,

802
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,199
she plays with it,

803
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,399
she holds it by a string,

804
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,359
she flies it like a kite.

805
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,559
It is the same moon that looks out
over Meiroun the real village,

806
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,319
and Meiroun the girl who
lives all over the world

807
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,319
because she doesn't live in her homeland,

808
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,159
she lives in the Diaspora.

809
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:18,039
In addition to drawing,
I am also a singer an a composer.

810
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:21,879
I studied oriental singing for
four years at the Lebanese Conservatoire..

811
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:27,159
<i>Ever(</i> time I participate in
a Palestinian concert or event,

812
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:31,639
I find myself, as if by instinct,
either wearing a thobe on stage

813
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:36,799
or wearing some other item
of Palestinian embroidery.

814
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,599
One of the songs that I have written

815
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,319
Is a song about the Palestinian 'thobe'.

816
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:46,599
Though I have never performed it

817
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:52,839
I have a Palestinian thobe

818
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:57,959
Always hidden away in the wardrobe

819
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:02,919
I have a Palestinian thobe

820
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,999
Always hidden away in the wardrobe

821
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,479
\
I wore it once and sang

822
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:16,119
About people of Haifa and Birzeit

823
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,279
I wore it once and sang

824
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:25,399
About people of Haifa and Birzeit

825
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,799
When back at home I packed it

826
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:34,159
Inside the wardrobe I hid it

827
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,639
I hid it and I wish that

828
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,439
It would return to its home

829
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:48,719
It will one day return to its home.

830
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:12,439
I really liked the embroidered
panel from Beer el-Sabih.

831
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,839
It embodies many stories, I
and many phases

832
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,119
it flows from
one phase to the other

833
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,079
and the last phase is joyful.

834
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,959
There is always full of hope.

835
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,199
It reminds me of a story

836
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,999
that had a major impact on my life..

837
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:30,119
After a long Diaspora,
and several moves from..

838
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,799
I was born In Jerusalem

839
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,319
we then lived
in Amman for a while,

840
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,559
then we moved to Beirut,

841
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,039
then I went to Tunis,

842
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,399
then I went to the US.

843
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,919
Finally, I returned to Ramallah.

844
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:45,759
However, throughout
my exile, I was always consoled

845
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,719
by the memory of a place,
my grandfather's house

846
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,159
which I will never forget.

847
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:57,799
The memory comes to me in
the form of an enormous door.

848
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,959
A door that I used to see as huge,

849
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,959
as if it were from the tale of Aladdin.

850
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,759
I would imagine it opening wide,
as if a treasure was waiting for me behind it

851
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:07,919
as if I was going to find someone special..

852
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:12,039
S0, when I first got married
and returned to Palestine,

853
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,719
I decided to go
to Jerusalem by myself.

854
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,919
I was going to face this memory

855
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,999
that had been haunting me all this time,

856
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,199
and I was going to prove to myself

857
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,479
that I belonged to this place

858
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:28,519
and that part of my memories
were connected to this place.

859
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,359
I eventually arrived
in the Old City of Jerusalem

860
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,519
to the Afghani corner,
right next to the Dome of the Rock.

861
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:39,839
I was very excited, believing that
I was going to find my life's dream.

862
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,759
I was going to confront it and see it.

863
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,639
I arrived and was shocked!

864
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:51,679
In place of an ancient
430-year-old wooden door,

865
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,199
I found a hideous iron door

866
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,479
painted all in green

867
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:02,479
a horrible color, that I couldn't believe
could have replaced the wooden door.

868
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:07,239
I knocked on the door hysterically.

869
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:11,079
A very handsome and graceful
young man opened the door.

870
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,799
When he first opened
the door with a smile on his face

871
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,639
I demanded “Where's the door?

872
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,439
Where's the original door of the house?"

873
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,159
He asked me “Who are you?”

874
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,959
And I replied
"I am the daughter of Ali and Fathiyeh

875
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,519
and this is my grandfather's house.

876
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,679
What are you doing here?

877
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:25,639
Where’s the door?

878
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,119
What you've done with it.

879
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:29,039
I demand to know
where you've put the door!”

880
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,919
He smiled gently and said to me
"Calm down, take it easy.

881
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,599
Please come inside and we'll talk.”

882
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,079
I went inside.

883
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,479
The courtyard was still the same

884
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,559
but they had transformed it into
a yard for remembrance gatherings (zikr).

885
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,319
I entered while he went
inside to make tea.

886
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,199
I started screaming

887
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,999
"You! You!
at are you doing here? Who are you?”

888
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,479
When he came back and
put the tea tray down on the table,

889
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,519
he looked at me and calmly said:

890
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,079
"I am your cousin.

891
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,199
I am Aouni, the son of your aunt Suheila.”

892
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,999
At that point I was stunned, I broke down.

893
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:07,079
He said "I will ask him if you could take the door

894
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,759
and I believe he will accept.”

895
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,559
The Sheikh did agree, and
the door is now in my house.

896
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:17,079
The door is here and
there are photos around it.

897
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:21,719
Those photos are the most

898
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,559
they are 'My Deceased'

899
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:25,839
to whom I am very attached.

900
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:29,199
There is a picture of my father, Ali TAHA

901
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,559
who became a martyr in 1972,

902
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:35,639
There is a picture of
Yasser Arafat, who raised me

903
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:40,519
and who also died in 2004.

904
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:45,119
Then there is a picture of my friend,
my lifelong friend, my husband's friend

905
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,159
my inspiration, and my mentor

906
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:52,119
from when I was a little girl
until he was taken from us

907
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,159
and passed away,
that is Mahmoud Darwish.

908
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:59,519
And there is a picture of the Iove

909
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,439
He too has become a picture...

910
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,759
The most important people
in my life have become pictures.

911
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,559
But I love them dearly

912
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:13,039
because they are not demanding.

913
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,959
Every day, I have my morning coffee

914
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:20,959
I do my reading,

915
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,079
all my life

916
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,759
takes place in front of this door

917
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:29,959
that was knocked on by all
the people I know and those I.don't. -

918
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,399
My grandfather, my grandmother,

919
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,279
my mother, my father,

920
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,839
my uncles, my cousins...

921
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:40,759
I look at this door and I imagine
all the fists that have knocked on it

922
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:43,519
or touched it, or closed it, or opened it

923
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,719
and I imagine beautiful tales.

924
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:50,199
So this door is a part of my life

925
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:54,719
and I think that, in addition
to many other things in my life,

926
00:54:55,120 --> 00:55:00,239
it is the beautiful memory
that allows me to remain steadfast

927
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,239
and rooted in this place.

928
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,599
My name is Leila Atchan

929
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,159
I am a resident of Ramallah.

930
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,239
My family is originally from
a village called Al-Haditha

931
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,479
near Ledd and Jaffa.
The village has been destroyed.

932
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:42,279
As a child, I studied in Jerusalem

933
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:45,119
and continued my education in the USA

934
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:48,799
at two universities,
Harvard and Rutgers

935
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,439
I am a psychotherapist

936
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:58,039
with many years' experience working
with people suffering from trauma,

937
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:01,559
those who were traumatized
during the two Intifadas in Palestine,

938
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:04,519
Palestinian refugees in Denmark,

939
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,199
and with other groups

940
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,319
in Jordan, with Iraqis,

941
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:12,719
and now with Syrian and
Palestinian refugees from Syria.

942
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,759
As a child, I barely used to see,

943
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,799
some colors and large objects,

944
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,839
but nothing really significant.

945
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,359
I have seen colors before

946
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:25,399
that's why when you name a color

947
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:30,399
I am able to imagine it
to picture it in my mind

948
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:35,679
I have to say that it's only recently
that I began to appreciate embroidery.

949
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,159
Now I love it.

950
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,479
On my handbag, my scarf.

951
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,879
I also had a dress made with embroidery.

952
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,919
To me, embroidery
is about identity in the positive sense.

953
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:47,519
It represents Palestinian
identity as I would like it to be,

954
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:49,399
an artistic identity.

955
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:55,999
The concept of colors in the embroidery
IS a reflection of Palestinian identity as I like it,

956
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,999
an identity that has the capacity
to accommodate differences.

957
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,319
Which has been gradually diminishing.

958
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:02,519
That may be why I've started
to appreciate embroidery again.

959
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,679
At the core of Palestinian culture,

960
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,399
we did have diversity,.

961
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,039
Many things were accepted.

962
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,799
The other day, I was talking
to a 75-year-old woman

963
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:16,799
and she told me that the girls used to walk
around 20 km, from one village to another,

964
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,679
to attend;a.dance or a wedding.

965
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,479
Today, there are so many restrictions

966
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:25,119
and rules that are limiting.

967
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:28,039
It is as if the piece
of embroidery is vanishing.

968
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,719
But I always like to keep in mind

969
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:35,679
that the colors and diversity
in this piece represent pride.

970
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:41,639
<i>A woman takes pride in I
her femininity, if 'the colors she chooses.</i>

971
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,159
- This one here?

972
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,279
They are like a zig-zag...

973
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,199
made up of..

974
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:55,759
I imagine a woman with all her intricate
emotions, working on her embroidery piece.

975
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,119
She's probably thinking of a hundred things.

976
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:03,679
She may have moments of happiness,

977
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,519
she may have a secret love,

978
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,719
she may have times of sadness,

979
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:10,479
she may have all these things, > 4

980
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,439
but in spite of it all, she was
able to produce this piece.

981
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,999
- Muna, come on, give me the answer

982
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:22,039
I can feel how all of these
are connected to each other.

983
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:26,679
Here, there is something like a square,
connected to this thing next to it.

984
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:29,439
Different shapes

985
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,279
but all somehow connected to each other.

986
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:35,799
I think this is what makes
the entire piece beautiful.

987
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:39,719
Whether it's a square, or
whatever it is that you call these shapes.

988
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,559
-Io.me,

989
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:44,799
embroidery is linked to
women who are like my mother.

990
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:48,999
The mother who was able
to work in secret and support her family,

991
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:54,119
who was able to stand up to the soldiers
when they ha me to the house and beat up my father

992
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:56,839
<i>she went.out proudly in her 'thobe?
and demanded that they release hims</i>

993
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,559
She was not afraid.

994
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,439
This kind of woman, who is strong,

995
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,559
who can be feminine,

996
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:03,679
who can be a mother,

997
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:04,999
who can be a fighter, : -

998
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,399
who can be all those things

999
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:11,839
at a time when society is
trying to limit and constrain her.

1000
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,639
Embroidery really
reminds me of her, the survivor.

1001
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:15,319
Embroidery really
reminds me of her, the surivor.

1002
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:19,759
The woman who has been able to persist
- -and to do so artistically and with femininity.

1003
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:23,599
My mother is still alive,
she is around 84 years old

1004
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,079
and she-still wears the 'thobe'
%'

1005
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:28,039
with a lot of pride.

1006
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:32,119
When she goes out, particularly to
special occasion, she always wears a 'thobe'.

1007
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:57,599
I am SUAD al-AMIRY,

1008
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,919
the founder of the RIWAQ Center

1009
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,439
<i>\ for the protection of heritage in Palestine. '</i>

1010
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:05,599
I was born in Damascus,
because my mother is Damascene

1011
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:07,359
and was raised in Amman.

1012
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,999
I studied at
the American University of Beirut.

1013
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:16,719
I spent my youth between
Jordan, Damascus and Beirut.

1014
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,079
I returned to Palestine
to teach at Birzeit University

1015
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,519
and since then
I have lived in Ramallah.

1016
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,519
In truth, I returned to Palestine

1017
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:29,439
because a part of me
has always searched for Palestine

1018
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,759
but the main reason for my return

1019
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:35,359
was my interest 2
in Palestinian architecture

1020
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:38,479
in 'architecture without
an architect' as it's called.

1021
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:43,759
I went to Palestine on a visit,
to study Palestinian architecture

1022
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:44,559
that was in 1981.

1023
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:47,599
I thou ht.I would be there

1024
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:49,879
I fell in love with Palestine,

1025
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:51,959
and I fell in love with a man in Palestine,

1026
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:56,599
and as a result I decided to take up
a teaching post at Birzeit University.

1027
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,399
From 1981 until now,
the six months have become almost 33 years.

1028
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:07,799
No one in my family embroidered.

1029
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,959
But that's not all,

1030
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:11,519
when I became aware of embroidery

1031
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,399
I became aware of class consciousness

1032
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,039
of class differences
when it comes to embroidery.

1033
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:19,039
I remember when a man
came to ask for my sister's hand

1034
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:24,519
the. room's mother wore a "'thobe"

1035
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,559
It made me want
to understand why my mother cried

1036
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:28,479
if the woman was wearing a "'thobe"?!

1037
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:31,119
Later on I understood that it was about
the distinction between urbanites and peasants.

1038
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:38,159
This piece...now I really have to
rid myself of my mother's prejudices

1039
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,759
and my first impressions.

1040
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,159
To me, it signifies something beautiful.

1041
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:48,039
Aesthetically, as an architect
or someone interested in art

1042
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:50,479
or someone who is highly visual,

1043
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:54,119
first of all, it is a beautiful
piece of art with.regards to.the colors,

1044
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:59,359
It could possibly be
an early form of abstract art

1045
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:02,159
one speaks of artists
such as Mondrian or others.

1046
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:05,159
If one doesn't know the
political background of the piece, '

1047
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:09,199
it could be by Miro
or any other modern artist.

1048
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,079
There is a recurring story

1049
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:16,279
the story of the 420 villages
that were bulldozed by Israel.

1050
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:17,599
They obliterated them.

1051
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:21,199
So, when I returned to Palestine, I
I began to research Palestinian architecture ,1

1052
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:27,879
I found that the villages that currently
exist in the West Bank and Gaza are actually 420!

1053
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:31,879
That's how the number 420
became a magical number for me.

1054
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,879
The Israelis destroyed 420 villages

1055
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:38,639
and we must protect
the remaining 420 villages

1056
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:42,519
I have always felt that
the struggle between us and Israel

1057
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:45,359
is over the identity of the place.

1058
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:49,799
There were many things the Palestinians
were unable to carry with them to the Diaspora

1059
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,239
they were able to carry
a diploma if they were educated

1060
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,999
they were able to carry a song to sing.

1061
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,999
<i>"-*</i> - - > —— Or the Palestinian accent
which I:still preserve 65 years later.

1062
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:05,399
I think embroidery is one of those things
that they were able to carry as a profession.

1063
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:12,479
Sometimes | feel that
embroidery is like a grandmother’s tale

1064
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,439
like a bed-time story,

1065
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:18,639
where children ask their mothers
"Please sing me Teta's tale".

1066
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:21,199
It's always the women who carry

1067
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:25,999
heritage and culture
to youngsters through storytelling.

1068
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,879
I feel that embroidery embodies that.

1069
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,599
It's like an oral story

1070
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:33,559
especially that every place has its own narrative.

1071
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,519
The embroidery of Ramallah
is different from that of Asdoud,

1072
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:39,919
the combination of white
and blue implies one thing

1073
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:46,319
the symbolism represents
fertility and bounty...

1074
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:50,879
I often feel it is similar
to the tale of 'Little Red Riding Hood'

1075
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,279
where each generation retells the story..

1076
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,719
Buildings are not transportable

1077
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:57,239
they are fixed in space

1078
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,319
but embroidery is migratory it's like a refugee.

1079
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:02,759
There is the notion of
'refugeehood' attached to it

1080
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,759
and there is also a sense of continuity.

1081
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,399
Where did I grow up? In Jerusalem.

1082
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:34,959
I'm a resolute Jerusalemite.

1083
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:36,719
I lived my entire life in Jerusalem

1084
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,639
until I was 19 and a half

1085
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,959
when I met a man and we got
married and moved to Martinique.

1086
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,319
We lived for five years on
the island of Martinique in the Caribbean.

1087
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:56,239
When I see this piece, I immediately
think of the tiles in my father's house.

1088
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:01,559
The tiles of my father's house in Baq'a
which appear to almost be embroidered,

1089
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:03,679
embroidered with a paintbrush
instead of a needle-.

1090
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,199
On Fridays when I have my day-off from work,

1091
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,279
I take walks around Baq'a.

1092
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,319
Nowadays, Baq'a has become
an all Jewish neighborhood.

1093
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:15,039
So, one day I stood
in front of my father's house

1094
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:18,199
and the idea of standing in front of the house

1095
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:23,279
was very provocative to the people
who are now living in my father's house.

1096
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:26,999
They bought the house
from the Israeli government.

1097
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,879
At the time, in 1998,
Netanyahu was Prime Minister

1098
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:34,079
the Israeli government wanted
to expropriate everything that existed,

1099
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:37,759
especially the most precious things
there are in Palestine, on its land

1100
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:39,159
other than its people -

1101
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:42,959
but they don't consider us humans nor want us around -

1102
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:44,639
are the Arab houses

1103
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,479
with their beautiful architecture

1104
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:50,839
and which they can sell off for millions.

1105
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:56,199
I never had the chance to live in the house
which is why I sometimes feel that..

1106
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:59,199
...that it's in my blood

1107
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:02,879
When she asked me,
the Israeli settler woman

1108
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:10,079
"I have the key , how can you prove that
this is your father's house?".

1109
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,399
I do have the documents,

1110
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:16,319
the deeds are with me at home
but I don't carry them around with me!

1111
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:17,639
I also worry about them.

1112
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,759
I need to keep them safe.

1113
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:22,839
Like the tiles or the pieces of embroidery
or the embroidered thobe,

1114
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:27,799
I hold on to the deeds that prove
that this is my father's house.

1115
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:31,159
So I said to her: “Right here,

1116
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:36,239
if you open it up, if you cut open my veins
you will know that it's my father's house".

1117
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:39,079
So, every time I go to my father's house,

1118
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:42,039
they call the police
and I get handcuffed

1119
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,079
and I get threatened with expulsion...

1120
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:19,319
But, if I were to tell you about
what there is inside my father's house,

1121
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,399
which I was only able to enter once

1122
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:25,799
when they were renovating the house...

1123
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:30,039
I was able to go in
because the doors were open

1124
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,439
and the workmen renovating Arab houses,

1125
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:37,679
like those who build
the apartheid wall and the settlements,

1126
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:40,479
are unfortunately Palestinian laborers.

1127
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,599
The man who was removing the tiles,

1128
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,319
was an Arab, a Palestinian.

1129
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:46,759
I found him removing the tiles
and I asked him "What are you doing?

1130
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,719
Why are you removing these beautiful tiles?”

1131
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,639
The most beautiful thing
in these old houses are the tiles.

1132
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:55,359
Nowadays, there is no one who
can make these beautiful designs.

1133
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:56,879
He answered me,

1134
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:58,399
"Well this is what they want

1135
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:01,719
the Jewish settlers want me
to take out all the tiles

1136
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:05,639
and rearrange them in
a different pattern and design”.

1137
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:11,719
I stood there observing him
and found him taking 10 at a time

1138
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:15,839
stacking them together in a wooden box

1139
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:18,039
like files, like an archive.

1140
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:19,639
Like so...
One after the other.

1141
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:24,439
Then he took them to
a corner behind the house.

1142
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:26,639
50, I grabbed an entire box

1143
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,759
and put it in my car.

1144
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:32,519
Then I took another one,
each had 10 tiles,

1145
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,679
and we made a stunning 'carpet' with them.

1146
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:38,439
This tile carpet,reminds me of embroidery.

1147
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:39,839
The geometric pattern,

1148
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:40,839
the colors of sand,

1149
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:41,719
of the sun,

1150
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:42,239
it's very beautiful..

1151
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:43,959
I feel like I have...

1152
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:45,959
How can I put it?

1153
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,999
Not that I have revived our heritage,

1154
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,279
we seem to think that
we actually revive heritage,

1155
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:55,679
but that I may have
documented my own story.

1156
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:58,839
My story , Huda's and
the story of my father, Farid

1157
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:02,279
who built a house and was deprived of it.

1158
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:07,119
Now the tiles are an integral part of my life.

1159
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,039
Dina Nasser,

1160
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:31,879
I was born in Jerusalem.

1161
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:35,039
I spent my youth in Jerusalem.

1162
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:37,919
I studied in England
and returned to Jerusalem,

1163
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,239
and now I work in Jerusalem.

1164
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,199
I am a Registered Nurse
and I also work as a health advisor.

1165
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:55,359
This piece of embroidery reminds me

1166
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:58,879
She always gave me gifts of
embroidery on birthday stand on my wedding.

1167
01:09:58,880 --> 01:09:59,799
When she gave.meithis‘piece

1168
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:00,839
I put it up in our house in Jerusalem

1169
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:01,959
I put it up in our house in Jerusalem
when we were newlyweds.

1170
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:04,759
Then we lived in Birzeit for a few years,

1171
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,679
and I hung it in our house in Birzeit. "

1172
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:08,119
Then we returned to Jerusalem

1173
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:08,999
without the embroidery

1174
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,719
and also without my husband.

1175
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:14,599
Because of the Zionist occupation

1176
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,199
I have to preserve my existence
and presence In Jerusalem

1177
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:19,239
because I cannot
live outside of Jerusalem.

1178
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:22,639
Yet we cannot live
with Youssef in Birzeit.

1179
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,159
If we were to live with him

1180
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:26,639
I would lose my Jerusalem ID
and that of my three children.

1181
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,599
And Youssef is not allowed
to come live with us in Jerusalem.

1182
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,679
He hasn't been granted
the 'Family Reunification' papers.

1183
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:35,159
He was born in Birzeit,
but his parents emigrated

1184
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:37,679
so he returned
to Palestine as an American

1185
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:39,479
him 'Family Reuni nation'.

1186
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:42,079
Even after we were married,
we tried four times.

1187
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,759
But until now he has not been granted it.

1188
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:46,159
This year it will be our
30th wedding anniversary,

1189
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:48,999
the past six, seven years
have been the toughest years.

1190
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,839
Because now we only
see each other on special occasions.

1191
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,519
Even on special occasions,
he cannot come here,

1192
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:56,439
even for weddings or funerals,

1193
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:59,239
but we visit him on special
occasions and over weekends.

1194
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:01,079
However, if we spend
too many days away

1195
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:03,479
they'd consider our main residence
to be outside of Jerusalem

1196
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,799
and the Israelis can come
and take away my Jerusalem ID

1197
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:06,879
if they can prove that.

1198
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:08,599
Our main residence is.outside Jerusalem.

1199
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:09,719
So we go to see him like visitors

1200
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:11,599
and when we leave,
it's as if we’ve committed a crime

1201
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,239
We obliterate all traces
of our presence there.

1202
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:18,119
This is part of the Israeli policy
for the ethnic cleansing of Jerusalem.

1203
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:20,199
So, if we decide to live
with Youssef as a family

1204
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:22,559
then with one stroke of the en

1205
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,519
And that way they would have
easily gotten rid of four people.

1206
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:25,679
But it doesn't end here,

1207
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:26,879
it's continuous hardship.

1208
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:29,399
If the children
travel to study abroad,

1209
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:30,999
they need to prove their
existence all over again

1210
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,239
when they return to Jerusalem.

1211
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:34,439
If they are studying abroad,
they are considered non-residents.

1212
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:36,319
If for any reason .
they stay on after their studies

1213
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:39,199
they are considered
as having left Jerusalem for good.

1214
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:41,479
I have accepted this,

1215
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:46,239
but I hope that I will not regret
having subjected my children to this life.

1216
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:49,679
Our children never had
the chance to have a stable family life.

1217
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:52,999
There have been many family occasions
when each of us was in a different corner

1218
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,679
even funerals,
like when my father passed away

1219
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:59,039
the Israelis didn't think it was sufficient justification
to give him an entry permit so that he can be with us,

1220
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:01,439
or when my daughter
fell and ended up in hospital,

1221
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:02,799
he wasn’t allowed to be with us.

1222
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:06,039
In Jerusalem, we are reminded
of the occupation on a daily basis

1223
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:07,999
because the repression is
continuous on a daily basis.

1224
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,359
There is a settlement close to us

1225
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:10,999
right next door.

1226
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,479
When the clashes started,

1227
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:14,479
they put up a barbed fence
between us and them.

1228
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:16,959
There is also a checkpoint
right next to the house.

1229
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:19,359
And they decide to close the checkpoint,

1230
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,399
we are obliged to take a long
detour as if we are going to the West Bank

1231
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:22,159
we have to circle the roundabout

1232
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:25,679
so that we can get back
to Jerusalem and cross the checkpoint.

1233
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:26,839
So yes,
when you live in Jerusalem

1234
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:28,679
You are faced with the.
ccupation on a daily basis.

1235
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,879
I cannot live
outside Jerusalem.

1236
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,519
I work at the Muttale' Hospital,

1237
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:33,519
when 1 go down the hill.

1238
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:34,159
and see Jerusalem

1239
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:35,039
I stop the car.

1240
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:36,679
Every single day, as I return home,

1241
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:38,599
I slow the car down
and I look out at Jerusalem,

1242
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:39,959
I take a deep breath

1243
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:41,879
and I say to myself,
“This is why I am here”.

1244
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:46,839
It's a continuous struggle
to validate our existence in Jerusalem.

1245
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:48,439
When my son Fares was born,

1246
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:49,999
I was unable .
to register him for six years,

1247
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,919
at the time, his father
had taken the West Bank ID

1248
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:53,479
and now was required
to have 'Family Reunification'.

1249
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:55,559
They had taken away
my ID and those of the kids.

1250
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:59,199
So one day, I decided
to call the Jerusalem Municipality

1251
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:00,559
to check where they had registered me.

1252
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,439
When I called, a woman answered

1253
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:05,639
she said to me “Sorry, you do not exist”

1254
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:08,119
I gave her my details
and my ID number

1255
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:11,599
I remember that .
that was 20 years ago, I cried.

1256
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:16,199
I said to myself “All this time
and now a I of a sudden I do not exist!”

1257
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:18,199
Just because someone decided
to simply strike me off?!

1258
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:19,839
Is it that simple
that “I don't exist”??

1259
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:22,479
I thought to myself, I should let
my son Fares loose in the Ministry of Interior,

1260
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:23,199
a six-year-old boy,

1261
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:24,399
to show you that he exists,

1262
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,199
that I exist

1263
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,239
that my children exist.

1264
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:27,799
That we all exist.

1265
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:56,439
That robe now finds its proper place
in the thread of the story.

1266
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:00,279
It has long ceased to be nearly a dress.

1267
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,319
Beauty is no longer its sole attribute,

1268
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:08,039
even though beauty remains
one of its most resplendent features.

1269
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:11,399
The surface of the robe
Is now the story-teller.

1270
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,519
Sometimes it is the homeland,

1271
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:15,719
and at others it is, of course, a profession.

1272
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:17,079
It is a memory,

1273
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:18,559
a heritage,

1274
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:19,799
a weight of history,

1275
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:21,279
a sense of duty.

1276
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,279
There is pride In it

1277
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:25,039
but also weariness,

1278
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:27,439
and both meet in it.

1279
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:32,759
Each woman sits and tells her story.

1280
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:36,759
She speaks of her present

1281
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:39,799
with fervor, lucidity and passionate love.

1282
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:41,839
With every stitch

1283
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,599
the woman is hiding a story,

1284
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,039
a thought,

1285
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:47,759
a sigh.

1286
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,319
The individual threads

1287
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:52,799
do not melt in some collective narrative

1288
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:55,519
even though they embroider that narrative.

1289
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,159
Twelve women,

1290
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,079
twelve life-spans

1291
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:04,439
and stories from Palestine,

1292
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:09,519
a land whose position was fixed
on the map o the world

1293
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:13,759
but is now embroidered on its face.
